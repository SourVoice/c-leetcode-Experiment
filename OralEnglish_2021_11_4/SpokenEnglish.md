My oral topic is talking about an animal. This is a specific animal.Since I have keeped a dog as my pet once. I want to talk about him.

His name is Maomao,in Chinese it mean's fur, but actually not meaning that he's Hariy( [ˈheəri] ). My family had keep him from 2010 to 2017 till he left us. We keeped him since i'm third-grade in primary school. And lost him when i'm sophomore( [ˈsɒfəmɔː(r)] ) class at high school. In some degree, he has accompanied my whole childhold. When i was yong, i usually go for a walk with him, i like watching him running`chasing and rolling on the ground when i touch its stomach.

After I go to boarding school, I can only go back home three weeks a time, and can only stay one night and half of a day. I didn't have such time to spend with him. I seemed to be more and more selifsh as i grow up, i usually pretended to ignore him and go on my things when he try to play with me. I now feel guilty about him for i'm not accompanied him when he needed me. Anyway, after he had gone, this things either good or bad has become my precious memory.
